# Admin Backend TODO
- User/role management: add admin, staff, and custom roles; restrict sensitive actions (delete, schema changes) to admins
- Customizable form schemas: allow admin to edit ticket/customer form fields, types, and validation rules
- RMA number schema: allow client to set RMA number length (8-15), composition (numeric or alphanumeric), and first two fixed letters (prefix); expose settings in admin UI and persist for ticket creation; allow preview of RMA format
- Ticket status and workflow customization: admin can define custom ticket statuses and allowed transitions
- Data export/import: CSV/Excel export for tickets/customers, import for bulk onboarding
- Audit log: track admin actions (deletes, edits, schema changes)
- Branding: allow admin to upload logo, set business info, and customize PWA appearance
- Backup/restore: admin can trigger backup and restore of all data
- Advanced search/filter: admin UI for searching/filtering tickets and customers by any field
- Localization/regional settings: admin can set default date format (e.g., mm-dd-yyyy, dd-mmm-yyyy, mm/dd/yy) and phone number format (US/UK/other) for all forms and displays; settings applied app-wide

# Other admin-controlled features discussed today:
- Schema-driven form editor: allow admin to add/remove/move date/signature/notes fields for ticket workflow steps (e.g., Reception, Inspection, Repaired, Shipped, etc.)
- Kanban board configuration: admin can enable/disable Kanban board, set default columns/statuses, and control drag/drop permissions


# Changelog
## [0.2.1] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed
- Bulletproofed customer/ticket deletion and navigation to prevent infinite update loops and errors
