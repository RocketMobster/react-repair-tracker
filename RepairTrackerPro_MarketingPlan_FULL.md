## 1. 1. Market Research Goals
Our goal was to validate the need for a customizable, modular repair management system targeted at small to mid-sized service departments, internal IT teams, and independent repair shops. 

Over 90 days, we conducted:
- Subreddit scans (r/sysadmin, r/repair, r/itdept, r/startups)
- Conversations on Reddit and Discord with repair techs
- Comparisons of competitor reviews
- Manual tracking of search trends like “repair shop software,” “repair ticket app,” and “offline PWA repair tracking”

Key Findings:
- Strong dissatisfaction with rigid or bloated ticketing systems
- High demand for mobile and offline-first solutions
- Low-code customization and plugin support are desirable but rare
- TAM includes ITSM market ($13.58B by 2025), FSM software ($5.9B by 2030), and the electronics repair vertical ($25.15B by 2030)


## 2. 2. Audience Segmentation
Segment 1: Independent Repair Shops
- Pain Points: Manual spreadsheets, lack of mobile apps, no workflow customization
- Channels: Reddit (r/repair), Instagram/YouTube, Facebook groups

Segment 2: Internal IT Teams
- Pain Points: Lack of role separation, inefficient resolution time, SLA compliance
- Channels: LinkedIn, industry webinars, GitHub

Segment 3: Field Technicians
- Pain Points: Offline access, device syncing, limited mobile functionality
- Channels: Field service communities, repair subreddits

Segment 4: DevOps/Builder Community
- Pain Points: Can’t extend proprietary tools, no plugin marketplace
- Channels: GitHub, Dev.to, Twitter/X

Each segment has a unique workflow and key value driver, reflected in tailored feature positioning.


## 3. 3. Unique Selling Propositions (USPs)
- Plugin-powered customization: Build your own extensions or use prebuilt plugins
- Role-based interfaces: Tailored UI views for admins, technicians, managers
- True PWA: Works offline for field use; installable on any device
- Workflow agility: Create new statuses, roles, and views without code
- Freemium + dev-first: Open enough to explore, powerful enough to scale


## 4. 4. Competitive Analysis
Competitor Landscape:
- Fixably: Focused on Apple repair shops, lacks plugin capability
- RepairQ: Integrates POS/inventory but lacks extensibility
- ServiceNow: Enterprise-only, over-featured, expensive
- Jira Service Management: Dev-friendly, but requires Atlassian ecosystem
- TOPdesk: Used in education/government but dated UI

RepairTracker Pro differentiates with:
- Plugin framework
- PWA/offline access
- Agile customization without code

Full SWOT and competitor comparison matrix included in the visual plan.


## 5. 5. Positioning & Messaging
Positioned as: “The repair ticket system that adapts to you.”

Tone: Professional but quirky — clever, no-nonsense, and lightly rebellious.

Messaging pillars:
- “Don’t fix what isn’t broken — unless it’s your ticket system.”
- “Track repairs. Assign roles. Save time.”
- “Customizable. Offline-ready. Delightfully nerdy.”

Use cases presented in plain English, but power-user features shown under “advanced” toggles or dev-mode views.


## 6. 6. Channels & Tactics
Primary channels:
- LinkedIn for IT pros and repair team leads
- Twitter/X for developer outreach
- Reddit (r/sysadmin, r/startups, r/repair)
- Blog content optimized for repair workflow/IT keywords
- GitHub (for plugin SDK and examples)

Tactics:
- Launch week plugin giveaways
- Share animated GIFs of plugin demos
- Publish articles like “Top 5 Fixes for Broken Ticketing Systems”
- Create template gallery for common use cases (IT, electronics, field repair)


## 7. 7. Product-Led Growth Hooks
- Freemium plan includes plugin support and role-based settings
- In-app Plugin Marketplace as a content surface
- “Time Saved” metric on dashboard (incentivizes retention)
- Upgrade prompts triggered by:
    - exceeding ticket/user limits
    - SLA violations
    - plugin usage thresholds


## 8. 8. Metrics to Track
- Core: Daily active users, tickets resolved per day, plugin install rate
- Engagement: Session length, users per org, plugin retention
- Financial: Upgrade conversion rate, plugin revenue (if monetized)
- Tools: Umami or PostHog for front-end tracking, Supabase logs, MailerLite open rates
